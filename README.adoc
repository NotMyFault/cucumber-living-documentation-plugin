BDD living documentation on your jenkins build via https://github.com/rmpestano/cukedoctor[Cukedoctor^]. 

== Introduction

The living documentation plugin basically scans for cucumber json output files in jenkins workspace in order to generate living documentation from it.

Cucumber json output files are generated after cucumber test using the json formatter:


[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(plugin = {"json:target/cucumber.json"} )
----
NOTE: *plugin* option replaced *format* option which was deprecated in newer cucumber versions.

Here is how a cucumber feature look like in a documentation:
